I want to see if I can still use the getRandomNumber() function to generate a number larger than a single digit but we'll see. I may need to create a new function that returns a number larger than a single digit matching the number length selected 



need to see how I can incorporate capital letters with the words based on selection.

I don't like the types of words being generated by https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=${length}&number=${number}. 
I should explore this npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words

I've moved this to a node project and now have express to handle the routing it's working fine when I initiate 'npm run dev'
I installed random-words but I'm still trying to figure out how to use it. I can't require("") in my public files like I can in my server.js so need to figure out how to use the npm package on the front-end
Somke suggestions online said to use Browserify: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19059825/5900050
-- So, I'll look into Browserify (or the like) to see if that gives me the ability.

Based on what I wrote yesterday I was able to replace the heroku random word api url with my own I created in server.js. I chose not to do browserify right now because I don't need a bunch of bundling right now, however, it could be a good direction in the future if I need to bundle.
-- so I created a routes folder to hold my routes. Rigth now, one for home page and one for the random word API
-- under routes/random.js this is the api which will utilize the the npm random-words to generate an array of words. Then, on the front end, I'm still looking in that array and randomly grabbing some words.
-- I decided to run the random-words on the server so I can populate the array before the page loads. If the array is empty on page load I will disable it as an option and put a message on screen or something that says that option is not available at this time.
-- To Dos:
          I need to resstrict input or add validation to "Password Length" input for Random Password because I can manually type a value and it lets the function run. I need to retrict to the minimum of 8.
          I need to have some error handling on the routes/random.js so that if it fails I can do something. So, need to research how that works.
          I also need to disable the word-based password on the front-end and display some error message saying it's unavailable at this time and try again later or refresh or something.
